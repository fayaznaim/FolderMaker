## FayaxFolderMaker

** Work in progress ** 
If you want to use this utility please copy the /FayaxFolderMaker/bin/Release/FayaxFolderMaker.exe - standalone exe


A small utility to create folders, hundreds, thousands of them. The "Simulate" button is very imprtant as it does NOT create the foldrers but it will simulate the creation of the folders and shows you what you are about to create.

** Folder names cannot create certain characaters ** 
** If a folder already exists in the target directory, a new folder with the same name will NOT be created. **

### First tab titled "List to folders": 
You can paste a list of words which will create your folder names.

### Second tab titled "Numbered": 
Numbered folders can be created with prefixes, postfixes can be added.

### Third tab titled "Calendar": 
Weekday and month name folders.

### Fourth tab is 'Custom Folders": 
You can type whatever folder name you want to have creeated.

### Fifth Tab "From Textfile":
Select a text file, the program will read the textfile that you point to to get the names of the folders.

### Fifth Tab, "Specialized Folder":
Here are some predefined folder names. I will add more here as I come across some that might be useful. 
Please feel free to make some suggesstions for more lists here. 

### About Tab: Contains information like the one in this readme.

Please see the wiki in github if you want to see the screenshots and some more explanation.
